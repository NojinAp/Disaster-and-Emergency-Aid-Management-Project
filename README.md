When disaster hits a nation, the most urgent task is to be able to provide the people affected with what they need as quickly and as efficiently possible. This project is to prepare an application that manages the list of items needed to be shipped to the area. The application is able to keep track of the quantity of each item needed, the number of items on hand, shipping the items and storing the data in a file for future use.

The types of items needed to be shipped in this situation are divided into two main categories:

1. Non-Perishable products, such as blankets and tents, that have no expiry date. We refer to these types of products as Items.
2. Perishable products, such as food and medicine, that have an expiry date. We refer to these products as Perishables.

The data of the items is read through data.dat file, and the content is copied into a new file named newdata.dat
